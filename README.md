# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Installation

To install the application, download or clone the repository from GitHub to your machine. Open the downloaded or cloned repository on your device using a text editor. Launch the index.html file on your browser to begin exploring the RSS feeds.

For more detailed instructions on cloning the repo please visit: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/.

## Instructions

On every feed there will be several entries you can click on an explore. The entry title will give you an idea what the link will be about. Click on any feed entry link title to explore further.

There is a menu (found by clicking on the hamburger button on the top left) that will list different feeds. Click on any of the menu feed links to switch to a different feed.

There are feed reader tests already implemented to ensure proper functionality of the feed reader app. These tests check the logic of the application in addition to the event handling and DOM manipulation. To add, review, or modify any of the current feedreader tests, open the feedreader.js file which uses the Jasmine framework. If you choose to add, review, or modify, make sure you have cloned or forked the repo.

## Dependencies

* Udacity for starter files.
* Jasmine for unit testing.
* jQuery for access to the DOM.
* Handlebars for templating.
* Google Fonts for fonts.
* Google API for Google Feed Reader API.
* JamieMason for Jasmine matchers.
